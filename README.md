### Hi there 👋

I'm Anna, a career changer navigating their way around coding, creating exciting and delightful interfaces! 

🔭 Current projects:
   - **The Truth Oracle** Seek the answers to those all important burning questions 🔮 Navigating my way through WordPress and creating a theme using PHP 🔍 Check out my progress [here](https://github.com/annawerno/TheTruthOracleWP)
   - **Werno Surfboards** From idea 💡 to conception 💻. Using the skills I have learnt so far, I designed a website based on a random generated brief: Werno Surfboards 🏄 View my progress [here](https://github.com/annawerno/werno-surfboards-v2.0)

🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply my new skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript by creating beautiful things. I am also learning WordPress and PHP as my side piece 🧩

🦸‍♀️ I feel like a superhero when I figure something out! The satisfaction of understanding and evolving my skills as a developer makes my decision to jump into this industry intoxicating

👯 I’m looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals who are also starting out in their tech journey
