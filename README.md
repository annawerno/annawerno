### Hi there 👋

I'm Anna, a career changer navigating their way around coding, creating exciting and delightful interfaces! 

🔭 My current project is my own porfolio website, the bones of which are [here](https://annawerno.co.uk)

🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply my new skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript by creating beautiful things. I am also learning WordPress and PHP as my side piece 🧩

🦸‍♀️ I feel like a superhero when I figure something out! The satisfaction of understanding and evolving my skills as a developer makes my decision to jump into this industry intoxicating

👯 I’m looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals who are also starting out in their tech journey

Let's connect and navigate this world together!
